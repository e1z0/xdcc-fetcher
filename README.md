# XDCC-Fetcher

XDCC-Fetcher is a cross-platform program that especially designed to work with XDCC as client. It comes with English, German, Hungarian, Lithuanian and Polish languages support.
XDCC-Fetcher is a fork of XDCC-Fetch, because it was no longer in development we have forked it to fix bugs and update with some new features.
